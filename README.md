All development tasks and milestones are tracked in our GitHub Project:

🔗 [Project Board](https://github.com/makreeltje/3d-printer/projects)

Each feature/bug has an issue with a structured checklist and category label (`frontend`, `backend`, `analytics`, etc.).

Labels are automatically maintained and used to update our live checklist issue.
